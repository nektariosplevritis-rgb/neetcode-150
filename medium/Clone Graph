133. Clone Graph
https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Hash Table, DFS, BFS, Graph

Status: ✓ Solved – 100% AC (Runtime beats 95%, Memory beats 98%)

Approach: DFS + Hash Map (old node → new node)
Time:  O(N + E)   – each node and edge visited exactly once
Space: O(N)       – hash map + recursion stack
