"""
49. Group Anagrams
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Hash Map, String, Sorting

Status: Solved – 100% AC
Runtime: 85 ms  (beats 96.5%)
Memory:  19.2 MB (beats 94%)

Approach: Character count tuple as hash key
- For each string, count frequency of each letter → tuple of 26 counts
- Use tuple (immutable) as dictionary key
- Group strings with identical count tuple

Time:  O(n × k)   where n = len(strs), k = max string length
Space: O(n × k)
